# Foolish Division Frontend
An Open Source Alternative to Splitwise.

[Backend Repository](https://github.com/kb3vwt/Foolish-Division)

## Motivation
Splitwise was a tremendously useful service until it became a bit 'greedy'. I frustratingly started this project to get
the core user experience back without having to pay Splitwise money to submit more than 3 expenses a day.

## Development
This project has just started. This will use a Django backend with a ReactJS frontend. Currently, this is being 
deployed to Render @ [www.foolish-division.com](https://www.foolish-division.com). Local development should use the
dev.yml Docker Compose to set up the backend and manually launch the frontend in a separate process.
